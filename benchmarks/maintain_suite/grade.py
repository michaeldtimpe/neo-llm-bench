"""Automated grader for the v1.0 acceptance suite.

Per plan §10: each fixture earns up to 5 points:
  - 1 pt — `llamabench maintain` opened a PR (status_done; not failed_no_mutations)
  - 3 pts — expected_outcome check passed
  - 1 pt — citation linter found zero unresolved citations

A fixture passes when it earns ≥4/5 points. v1.0 ships when ≥8/10 pass.
