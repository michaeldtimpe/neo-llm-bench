"""Diff-aware citation linter — verifies file:line tokens in the final report.

Per plan §6: this is a build-breaking gate for v1.0. Zero unresolved citations
across all acceptance fixtures is a release requirement.

Diff-aware: when workers edit a file, the original line numbers shift. Strict
line-existence checking would fail those runs spuriously. Instead we use the
ValidatorEnvelope `snippet` field — workers and the synthesizer carry the snippet
verbatim alongside `path:line`, and the linter does a fuzzy snippet match
within ±20 lines of the cited line in the post-edit file.

Resolution outcomes per citation:
  - resolved        — file unchanged, line exists, snippet (if any) matches
  - resolved_shifted — file edited, snippet matches within ±20 lines of cited line
  - resolved_by_deletion — file deleted in diff (intentional fix, OK)
  - missing_file    — file does not exist in current state, not deleted in diff
  - out_of_range    — file unchanged but cited line is past EOF
  - content_mismatch — file unchanged but the line at cited line doesn't match snippet
  - shifted_unverified — file edited, snippet not found within ±20 lines
