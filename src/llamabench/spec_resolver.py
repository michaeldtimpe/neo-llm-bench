"""Spec resolver — assemble `.sdd` chains for a target file (Lever 2).

Given a repo root and a target path, walks from the target's containing
directory up to the repo root, collecting `<dir>/<dir>.sdd` contracts at
each step. Returns an ancestor-first chain — the closest ancestor `.sdd`
to the repo root comes first, the closest to the target comes last —
so leaf-level rules can override or extend root-level invariants.

The convention: each directory `<dir>/` may contain `<dir>/<dir>.sdd`
where the file's basename matches the directory's name. Directories
without a matching `.sdd` are silently skipped.

Globs in `Owns:` / `Forbids:` / `Depends on:` sections are interpreted
relative to the **repo root**, not relative to the `.sdd`'s containing
directory. This keeps glob semantics consistent across all `.sdd` files
in the chain — a `Forbids: tests/**` in `src/llamabench/llamabench.sdd` means the
same thing as the same glob written in `src/llamabench/agents/agents.sdd`.

Glob syntax (gitignore-style, hand-rolled because pathlib's `match` does
not support `**` until Python 3.13):
    *       — any chars except `/`
    **      — any chars including `/` (i.e. crosses directories)
    ?       — single char except `/`
    [...]   — character class
Other regex metacharacters are escaped.
