"""Spec predicate evaluator — validates a Spec against a working tree.

Lever 1 of SpecDD (see ~/.claude/plans/fluffy-brewing-lemur.md). Takes a
Spec and a repo path and returns per-requirement satisfaction. The
synthesizer uses this before declaring "done"; the cli reprompt block
uses this to construct structured "Requirement R2 unsatisfied" payloads.

Predicate kinds:
- regex_present: pattern matches in N+ added lines of the diff
- regex_absent: pattern must NOT appear in any added line
- tests_pass: shell command exits 0 in repo_path
- ast_query: stubbed at v1.4-prep — full tree-sitter integration deferred
- manual: returns unsatisfied with "needs human review" detail

Diff parsing mirrors `_diff_against_base` in cli.py (uses `git add -N` to
make untracked files visible). The added-line extraction is duplicated
from `_check_regex_present` in `benchmarks/maintain_suite/grade.py` — a
shared `src/llamabench/diff.py` module would dedupe both call sites; deferred
until the integration shape is settled.
