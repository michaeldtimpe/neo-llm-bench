"""CVE lookup tool — queries the OSV.dev advisory database for known
vulnerabilities affecting a package version.

Closes the audit-hallucination caveat from v1.1's deps-audit (see
`project_tool_subphases_and_cve_lookup.md`). Before this tool, the
`manage_strict` overlay pushed the model to produce CVE-shaped findings
in the right structural shape, but the bench's regex grader couldn't
distinguish a real CVE id from a plausible-but-invented one. With this
tool the model can ground its findings in deterministic upstream data.

Backed by https://api.osv.dev/v1/query — free, public, no auth, multi-
ecosystem (PyPI, npm, Go, Maven, RubyGems, crates.io, NuGet, ...).
Responses are cached to ~/.llamabench/cve_cache/ with 24h TTL so repeat
lookups within a multi-fixture bench run don't pound the API.

Response is compressed before returning to the model: only id, aliases
(e.g. ['CVE-XXXX-YYYY']), summary (truncated), severity score, fixed
versions, and the top advisory URL survive. The full OSV.dev response
includes long prose 'details' blocks and ecosystem-specific chaff that
would otherwise burn prompt tokens with no benefit.

Aliases are load-bearing: OSV.dev uses GHSA as the primary id while
audit consumers (and bench grader regexes) expect CVE ids. Surfacing
the aliases lets the model cite any id from the lookup response —
GHSA, CVE, PYSEC — rather than relying on training-data recall.
