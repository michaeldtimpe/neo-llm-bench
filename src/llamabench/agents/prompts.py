"""Prompt registry — single source of truth for mono-mode prompts.

Editing norm: **all mono prompt edits must go through this registry.** Do
NOT scatter string literals in `single.py` or anywhere else; they will
silently un-couple the variant cells from the actual runtime prompt and
make the prompt-shaping bake-off uninterpretable.

The registry holds named `PromptVariant` entries. Each variant has:
  - `system`: the full system prompt sent to the model
  - `task_prefix`: text appended after the dynamic "Task type / Goal"
    header in `run_single`'s task prompt construction

`single.py` looks up the active variant via `RoleConfig.system_prompt_id`
and `RoleConfig.task_prompt_id`. The `baseline` entries are byte-equivalent
to the prior hardcoded `_SYSTEM_PROMPT` and inline task-prompt suffix in
`single.py`, so cells with default IDs reproduce current behaviour exactly.

See `~/.claude/plans/jiggly-baking-kahan.md` §1 for the variant rationale.
