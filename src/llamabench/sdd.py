"""SDD — `.sdd` file parser for SpecDD Lever 2.

A `.sdd` file is a plain-markdown contract that lives next to the code it
governs (`src/llamabench/agents/agents.sdd` for `src/llamabench/agents/`). It carries
six canonical sections:

    # Title (H1; one line)

    Optional preamble prose (free text; not parsed).

    ## Must
    - Statement 1
    - Statement 2

    ## Must not
    - Anti-pattern 1

    ## Owns
    - src/llamabench/spec.py
    - src/llamabench/spec_validator.py

    ## Depends on
    - src/llamabench/agents/

    ## Forbids
    - tests/**
    - **/test_*.py

    ## Done when
    - Statement of completion criterion

`Owns`, `Depends on`, and `Forbids` are path globs (relative to the repo
root). `Must`, `Must not`, and `Done when` are prose statements (one
bullet per statement).

Section names are case-insensitive and tolerate `must_not` / `must-not` /
`must not`. Each section is optional — a `.sdd` with only `Forbids:` is
valid (e.g., a fixture-scoped writeguard with no positive contract).

This parser is deliberately strict-but-small: it does not interpret the
glob syntax (that's `spec_resolver.py`'s job); it does not validate that
referenced paths exist; it does not enforce ordering of sections. Its
single responsibility is to turn `.sdd` text into an `SddFile` dataclass.
