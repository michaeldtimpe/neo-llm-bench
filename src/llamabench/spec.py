"""Spec — programmatic Definition of Done for fixture goals.

This is Lever 1 of the SpecDD phase (see ~/.claude/plans/fluffy-brewing-lemur.md).
A Spec decomposes a prose goal into a list of Requirements, each with its own
done-when predicate kind. Synthesizer validates against the Spec before declaring
"done" rather than relying on diff-size heuristics.

Status note (2026-05-03): the SpecDD plan was authored under the assumption that
compound-goal shadowing was the bench's primary ceiling. Post-v1.3 audit
(`project_compound_goal_audit.md`) showed compound goals are addressed
correctly by the current model on the current bench. This data model still
ships at v1.4 because:
  1. **Programmatic Definition of Done** has architectural value beyond
     compound-goal rescue (replaces the diff-size heuristic in the v1.3
     reprompt with a per-requirement check).
  2. **Per-requirement grading** is bench-rigor work — the loose-grader
     audit (`project_loose_grader_audit.md`) found 5/10 fixtures' regex
     graders are looser than their goal text. Per-requirement schema
     forces fixture authors to enumerate each sub-deliverable.
  3. **Future Lever 2/3** depend on this data model for `.sdd` chains
     and methodology A/B.

Prose-mode rescue (the residual nothing-doc-config FAIL) is NOT a deliverable
of this Spec model — directive reprompt's 0/1 observed rescue rate suggests
prompt-based reprompt mechanisms don't reliably break the model's prose-mode
decoder loop. Structural fixes (tool-level intervention) are out of scope here.
